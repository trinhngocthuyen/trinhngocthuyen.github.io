      <title>CI: Heuristically Extracting Test Methods Before Runtime</title>

      <description>1. Introduction Reducing pipeline time is a key problem in the pipeline time reduction epic. As mentioned in the previous post, this can be done by dividing tests in the project into smaller sets and run them in parallel CI jobs (sometimes called runners). The assignment of what tests to what jobs usually takes place at the end of the build job, before tests being executed. In order to assign/distribute tests to runners, we must know what tests we have.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction 1.1. Pipeline Time Improvement As engineers, we always want to land our change on master as quickly as possible. Apart from the time it takes to resolve code review comments from peers, there&amp;rsquo;s one constraint engineers have to face before getting their changes merged. That constraint is the CI pipeline time (ie. the time it takes for a CI pipeline to run against certain changes).
For iOS development, a typical CI pre-merge pipeline usually involves building the project, then running unit tests and UI tests.</description>

      <description>Whether you are a fan of Github, Gitlab, BitBucket, or any git-based repo hosting platform, I am sure you must be farmiliar with project labels.
Categorizing (messy) project issues A common use case of project labels is to categorize project issues of a repo. For engineering discussion, we use Slack (or any alternative for instant messaging platform) only for quick discussions. Those usually end shortly. If such a discussion become lengthy, probably you used the wrong communication channel 😀?</description>

      <title>When iOS CI/CD config is not just a file or a dashboard</title>

      <description>A while ago, when I heard the term &amp;ldquo;CI/CD&amp;rdquo;, I always thought of a dashboard to drag and drop, upload certificates and input the scheme&amp;hellip; blah blah. That&amp;rsquo;s all! And I was kinda believe that a good CI/CD platform must be like that: convenient, as few setups as possible. Now, I have a different viewpoint. What I very much expect in a CI/CD platform is the ability to customize workflow. This does not mean those drag-and-drop platforms are inadequate.</description>

      <description>1 Khi mình join team, công ty mình host các projects trên Github. Một dev mới vào công ty sẽ được add tài khoản Github cá nhân mình vào tài khoản organization của công ty. Lúc ấy, trên Github profile của bạn sẽ hiển thị membership với công ty (bạn phải public cái membership thì người khác mới thấy được nha). Nếu bạn làm cho công ty nào ok, hoặc thuộc dạng top-notch trong nước/khu vực, thì Github profile của bạn sẽ có-vẻ đẹp hơn một tí.</description>

      <description>In this post, I am going to talk about my experiences when working with CI/CD for iOS applications and some valuable lessons I learned.
1 In the past few months, I have been intensively working on CI/CD features in my team. My teammates sometimes refer to me as &amp;ldquo;the CI guy&amp;rdquo;. Before me, &amp;ldquo;the CI guy&amp;rdquo; was someone else who is humble, and quiet. After he left the company, I became the main PIC for CI/CD-related issues.</description>

      <description>Markov chain is a very important piece of probability and statistics. One application we could name is Markov Decision Process (MDP) used for decision making. Another one is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), a popular sampling method in statistics. You may also know Google PageRank algorithm, which is part of the ground of Google indexing technology. The algorithm is implemented on top of this concept&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Expectation (also called expected value or mean) is a very important concept in probability and statistics. One usage we could name is estimation in statistics in which we try to infer the parameters of a statistical model. Another simple application is the step of sanity checks in training a nerual network: verify if the loss function gives a value which is acceptably around its expectation&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>When it comes to iOS architecture, MVVM is one of the most favorable candidates. Not only does it provide higher testability than MVC but also this architecture is lightweight as compared to its counterparts such as VIPER. Despite that, proper approaches should be adopted to take advantage of MVVM. Otherwise, we could end up with an alike version of MVC with an additional component (ViewModel).</description>

      <description>A while ago, I read the book Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers written by Cam Davidson-Pilon and was really impressed by an example of carrying out surveys. Although it is not a standard method with wide scope of use, from the perspective of a software engineer who is not from statistics background, I think its idea is pretty beautiful and worth knowing</description>

      <guid>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-swizzling-what-why-and-how/</guid>
      <description>Method swizzling is a very powerful technique that takes advantage of dynamism. The core idea of this technique is to replace the real implementation of a method at runtime. With this power, we could be able to do a lot of cool stuffs. Actually, this special feature is offered by the Objective-C runtime, via message dispatch.</description>

      <guid>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-dispatch-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>Method dispatch is a term referring to mechanisms by which the program determines which operation should be executed (by operation, I mean a set of instructions). There are times we expect a method behavior to be determined only at runtime. This motivation give rise to different mechanisms of dispatching a method, each of which has its own pros and cons.</description>

      <description>Everytime we create a new file, Xcode suggests some built-in templates that may be useful. Luckily, we could also create our own templates.
Technically, Xcode looks for templates in ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates and /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates. Let&amp;rsquo;s call the first path P1 and the second path P2. A template could be iferred by a folder MY_TEMPLATE.xctemplate.
Assume we gonna create a template for MVVM. It should create 3 files: [Feature]Model.swift, [Feature]ViewModel.swift and [Feature]ViewController.swift. Ex: LoginModel.</description>

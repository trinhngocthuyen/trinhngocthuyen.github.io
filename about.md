Hi! I am Thuyen Trinh. I am currently based in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. As a "young" developer, I find myself in a thirst of knowledge, not only about programming, but also other interesting stuffs. 

I believe sharing culture lies at the heart of spreading knowledge and acquiring more in return. Also, by writing down your understanding, we are challenging ourselves to become a self-teacher, which is a perfect mean of systematizing and reinforcing your knowledge.

This blog came to existence with the same purposes.

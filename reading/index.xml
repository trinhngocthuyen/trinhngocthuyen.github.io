      <description>[5] Flavors of Engineering Management  #software-engineering #management - Benjamin pointed out some different types of engineering management. The three mentioned varies from responsibilities, team size and coverage of expertise. - One key thing I take from the post is the potential risk of the combination of multiple roles in a single person.
 One of the biggest risks is micromanagement because the manager still works as a contributor on the team.</description>

      <description>[5] Spaced repitition in learning theory  #learning #methodology - Without revision, we tend to forget things not long after we have just learned it. The forgetting curve is set to drop dramatically then. So it&amp;rsquo;s better to review when we start forgetting. Normally, the interval since the last revision extends. For example, 3 days after learning something new, review it. Then take the next review 5 days later, then 7 days later&amp;hellip; - A difficulty of applying this technique is to determine when to review.</description>

      <description>[6] Artwork Personalization at Netflix  #netflix #technology #recommendation - I really üíõ this article. Selection recommendation is not only about suggesting items that match users&amp;rsquo; interests but also about personalizing suggestions based on their perferences. For example, it may be better if we display a romance scene as the artwork of a movie if users tend to watch romance movies. Another typical example is using an artwork that has a character of their interest in order to increase users&amp;rsquo; engagement.</description>

      <description>Jan 07, 2018 [7] The 5 Problem-Solving Skills of Great Software Developers  #advice - I particularly enjoy the example of making coffee and how it demonstrates the similarity between software engineering and usual activities. Putting aside software engineering stuff, a typical person also attempts to achieve such ultimate goals (the skills mentioned).

      <description>Dec 30, 2017 [4] [Quora] I have a toddler. How should she prepare herself for the job market 15 years from now in the world of AI? Should I teach her Python as soon as she is willing to learn? - Interesting question! Early education is crucially important. Letting children get exposed to such materials is a very good mean of preparation for their future. This reminds me of a documentary I watched on Netflix last week: &amp;ldquo;The Mars generation&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; A generation of teenage scientists, explorers, and those who carries human&amp;rsquo;s quests for conquering the universe.</description>

A üê•&amp;rsquo;s sound typically follows specific patterns which express specific messages. By conveying these using machine learning, we could improve farming.</description>

      <description>*Hola! Today witnessed the commencement of the Reading Corner. This column features a mixture of what I have read that I think is worth a look. Most of them will be like random thoughts on various topics (in brief), written in either English or Vietnamese. If you happen to read these posts and would like to share your own opinion, please feel free to leave your comment below. Will try to keep it constant :)*</description>

Sometimes, I got frustrated with the fact that my SSH keys were cleared from agents after rebooting. As a result, I had to manually add those keys to agents every time my computer restarted (although it's not occasional)... It's best to automate such tasks - I thought. So, I asked *"how to run a shell script on login?"*. And here are some solutions.

### Option 1: Automator

- Open ***Automator***. Choose ***Application*** from the templates.
- Choose ***Run Shell Script*** from the action list.
- Paste your code there (see the figure below). For convenience, I launch another script which I could easily open and edit.

- ***Save*** the application.
- Open ***System Preferences*** -> ***Users & Groups*** -> ***Login Items***. Then, add the application you have just created.

### Option 2: Daemons

- Create a plist file in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` (ex. `com.thuyen.loginscript.plist`):

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
	<dict>
		<key>Label</key>
		<string>com.thuyen.loginscript</string>
		<key>ProgramArguments</key>
		<array><string>/Users/thuyentrinh/scripts/on_login.sh</string></array>
		<key>RunAtLoad</key>
		<true/>
	</dict>
</plist>
```
ðŸ”– *<u>Note</u>*: For some reasons, the plist does not work with the executable path like `~/scripts/on_login.sh` (`~` for HOME directory). Explicit path `/Users/thuyentrinh/scripts/on_login.sh` solves the problems... My MacOS is 10.13; maybe that matters ðŸ™„. I did not test it in earlier MacOS versions.

- Load the daemon: 

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.thuyen.loginscript.plist
```

- You could verify if the daemon is loaded by listing out services

```
launchctl list | grep loginscript
```

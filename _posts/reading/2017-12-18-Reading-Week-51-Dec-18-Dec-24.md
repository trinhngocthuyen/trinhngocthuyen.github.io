[[6] Apple Plans Combined iPhone, iPad & Mac Apps to Create One User Experience](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-20/apple-is-said-to-have-plan-to-combine-iphone-ipad-and-mac-apps){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#news #ios #macos</post-content-tag>
- This is nothing a rumor. Dave Verwer (from iOS Dev Weekly) shared his thought on it. He thought that the future of MacOS and iOS won't probably go that way.

[[5] How to Fit UX/UI into Agile and Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2016/november/agile-scrum-and-ux-ui){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#agile #scrum</post-content-tag>
- I really enjoy this article. I always find collaborating with designers is kind of challenging due to their distintive nature. Sometimes, it was their side that held the project back. This is not a blame but my view on the bottleneck of the software process I've experienced.
> In addition, UX is supposed to not only be inspired but also informed by user testing. Imagine the delays this could bring into a single vertically sliced story. Additionally, designers cannot create a design based on a single vertically sliced story, because they have to consider the whole user journey. For this reason, they tend to prefer designing on an epic level
- At the end of the day, it's all about *working with people*. Learning to code is much easier than learning to collaborate with people since human is always UNPREDICTABLE.

[[3] The Senior Engineerâ€™s Guide to Helping Others Make Decisions](http://silverwraith.com/blog/2017/10/the-senior-engineers-guide-to-helping-others-make-decisions){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#soft-skills #problem-solving #mentor</post-content-tag>
- I really enjoy this article. The way the senior engineer helped the junior one in the third conversation is awesome. Though I am not a senior engineer, this inter-personal skill is extremely necessary for collaboration with others.
- A vital factor contributing to the power of this tip is how language is used: *"That's a good point", "That would be great"*.


[[2] No more rainbows!](https://agilescientific.com/blog/2017/12/14/no-more-rainbows){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#data #visualization</post-content-tag>
- In short, despite that rainbow colomap is eye-catching, it has some drawbacks in terms of interpretation and readability. There's a good point to reason about solutions:
> I think what people like is the colour variance â€” it acts like contours, highlighting subtle features in the surface

[[1] Why VIPER is a bad choice for your next application](https://medium.com/@Pr0Ger/why-viper-is-a-bad-choice-for-your-next-application-725f4e16fbee){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#ios #architecture #VIPER</post-content-tag>
- I have to admit that my first experience with VIPER is not quite positive. Although separation of responsibilities is obviously a huge benefit it has brought, this architecture is kind of complicated with a lot of components. A bit like overengineered (just my personal feeling).
- Another article on the same topic: [#8 VIPER to be or not to be?](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/03/07/8-viper-to-be-or-not-to-be). TLDR: Just take a look at the diagram at the end of the post.

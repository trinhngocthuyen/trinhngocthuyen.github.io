[[3] The Senior Engineerâ€™s Guide to Helping Others Make Decisions](http://silverwraith.com/blog/2017/10/the-senior-engineers-guide-to-helping-others-make-decisions){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#soft-skills #problem-solving #mentor</post-content-tag>
- I really enjoy this article. The way the senior engineer helped the junior one in the third conversation is awesome. Though I am not a senior engineer, this inter-personal skill is extremely necessary for collaboration with others.

[[1] Why VIPER is a bad choice for your next application](https://medium.com/@Pr0Ger/why-viper-is-a-bad-choice-for-your-next-application-725f4e16fbee){:.post-link-reading} <post-content-tag>#ios #architecture #VIPER</post-content-tag>
- I have to admit that my first experience with VIPER is not quite positive. Although separation of responsibilities is obviously a huge benefit it has brought, this architecture is kind of complicated with a lot of components. A bit like overengineered (just my personal feeling).
- Another article on the same topic: [#8 VIPER to be or not to be?](https://swifting.io/blog/2016/03/07/8-viper-to-be-or-not-to-be). TLDR: Just take a look at the diagram at the end of the post.

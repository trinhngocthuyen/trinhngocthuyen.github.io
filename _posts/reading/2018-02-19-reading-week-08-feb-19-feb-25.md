[[5] Flavors of Engineering Management](http://blog.benjamin-encz.de/post/flavors-of-engineering-management/){:.post-link-reading} <rate4/> <content-meta>#software-engineering #management</content-meta>
- Benjamin pointed out some different types of engineering management. The three mentioned varies from responsibilities, team size and coverage of expertise.
- One key thing I take from the post is the potential risk of the combination of multiple roles in a single person.
> One of the biggest risks is micromanagement because the manager still works as a contributor on the team. Another risk lies in the combination of technical and people leadership in a single role. In most cases the teach lead engineering manager should try to turn someone on their team into a technical leader (without people responsibility), such that the team depends less on a single person

- I first read this article last year. Today, I revisited it and, still, it inspired me... a lot. Indeed, sometimes *debugging mode* takes way more time than *programming mode*. To become an experienced developers, we should also invest in debugging skill which is the result of habitual actions such as *providing context/info for others*, *listing and testing (hidden) assumptions*.

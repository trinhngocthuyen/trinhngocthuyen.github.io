[[3] The Three Levels of Software: Why code that never goes wrong can still be wrong](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html){:.post-link-reading} <rate4/> <content-meta>#software-engineering</content-meta>

[[1] Overcoming Imposter Syndrome](https://www.techinasia.com/overcoming-impostor-syndrome){:.post-link-reading} <rate3/> <content-meta>#advice</content-meta>
- I came to know this phenomenon when I took [a video lecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview/lecture/zTZEg/imposter-syndrome-and-stereotype-threat) on Coursera. In the video, [Christine](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/alvarado/), the course instructor, mentioned [Vanessa's case](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-gets-to-graduate.html) as an example of this syndrome... Vanessa was the first one in her family made it to college. She was admitted to a really selective university. Not long after starting her first year, she was devastated due to failing a test. She called her mom for consolidation and received a reply like: 
> "Maybe you just weren’t meant to be there. Maybe we should have sent you to a junior college first."
- → This syndrome is not only from your internal feelings but also from external beliefs people impose on you.

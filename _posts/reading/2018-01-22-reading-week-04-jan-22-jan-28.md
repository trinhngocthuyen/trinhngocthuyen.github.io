[[6] December Book – Flatland](https://lifethroughamathematicianseyes.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/december-book-flatland/){:.post-link-reading} <rate3/> <content-meta>#reading #books</content-meta>
- Hồi lâu mình cũng đã có 1 bài viết về Flatland, nhưng đó là review của bộ phim hoạt hình. Bạn có thể xem bài viết [ở đây](https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/2016-01-15-flatland-vung-dat-phang.html). Bộ phim khiến mình rất thích thú.
- Về sách, thì [review trên goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/433567.Flatland) không được tốt như mong đợi (~3.81/5) so với những cuốn khác (hầu hết đều trên 4.0/5). 
- Review trong blog post trên nêu bật được nội dung chính, và khiến mình thấy hấp dẫn. Ah, có một điểm cần lưu ý đối với độc giả non-native English speaker: cuốn này văn phong chắc sẽ khó nhai chút xíu, vì nó được viết khá lâu rồi (1800s).

[[5] Learning faster as an entrepreneur](https://qotoqot.com/blog/learning-faster/){:.post-link-reading} <rate3/> <content-meta>#learning #methodology</content-meta>
- The mainstream point of the author is that we don't need to fully understand pieces of a field. Instead of step-by-step learning, we could also just acquire 80% of a field (compenent enough) to significantly reduce the time needed.<br>
(1) *Finding*. Make use of available solutions.<br>
(2) *Skimming*. General idea first, don't dive into details unless you need it.<br>
(3) *Retaining*. Recognition is easier than recall. Note taking is necessary to recover the learned material. Use it in combination with *spaced repitition*. <br>
(4) *Organizing*. It takes time to absore new concepts. Don't try to grasp them all at once.


[[4] Last days in Vietnam](https://www.netflix.com/watch/70299908){:.post-link-reading} <rate4/> <content-meta>#history #war</content-meta>
- This documentary really touched my heart. We all know that history is written by the winners. I would not argue how much it was twisted. The chaos of the evacuation was horrible.

[[3] The Three Levels of Software: Why code that never goes wrong can still be wrong](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-three-levels-of-software-why-code.html){:.post-link-reading} <rate4/> <content-meta>#software-engineering</content-meta>
- The post starts with defining general terms in different levels of conceptualization. The 3 different ways of understanding *what it means to be wrong* results in different approaches to tackle a problem. *If you identify a problem and understand it, you half-way solving it*.

[[2] The rise and fall of the Berlin Wall - Konrad H. Jarausch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9fQPzZ1-hg){:.post-link-reading} <rate3/> <content-meta>#history #war</content-meta>

[[1] Overcoming Imposter Syndrome](https://www.techinasia.com/overcoming-impostor-syndrome){:.post-link-reading} <rate3/> <content-meta>#advice</content-meta>
- I came to know this phenomenon when I took [a video lecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-tech-interview/lecture/zTZEg/imposter-syndrome-and-stereotype-threat) on Coursera. In the video, [Christine](https://sites.google.com/a/eng.ucsd.edu/alvarado/), the course instructor, mentioned [Vanessa's case](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/magazine/who-gets-to-graduate.html) as an example of this syndrome... Vanessa was the first one in her family made it to college. She was admitted to a really selective university. Not long after starting her first year, she was devastated due to failing a test. She called her mom for consolidation and received a reply like: 
> "Maybe you just weren’t meant to be there. Maybe we should have sent you to a junior college first."
- → This syndrome is not only from your internal feelings but also from external beliefs people impose on you.

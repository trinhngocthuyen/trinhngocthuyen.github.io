[[4] The 10 statistical techniques data scientists need to master](https://jameskle.com/writes/stat-learning){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#data-science</content-meta>
- TLDR. Details later. TIL: *Shrinkage* --> *regularization*.

[[2] The Guide to Mobile App Design: Best Practices for 2018 and Beyond](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/mobile-design/guide-mobile-app-design-best-practices-2018-beyond){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#mobile #ux #design</content-meta>
- A bit lengthy, but informative. Can treat it as a handbook of mobile UX design.
- [Not quite relevant] A minor detail about the usability of this website. When I scrolled down and saw the ads "All for free", I thought it was the end of the article and hit *Cmd + W* to leave the page. When revisiting it, I realized that I did not read the remaining content... Why? I guess it's because the advertisements do look a lot like a website *footer*.

[[1] Basics of parallel programming with Swift](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/basics-of-parallel-programming-with-swift-93fee8425287){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#ios #concurrency #parallelism</content-meta>
- This post provides a very good overview of how to deal with concurrency (the article did not mention much about parallelism as in the title). One take-away I am interested in is the example in the mention of *Atomic*. I thought it is the OS's duty to guarantee proper operations on 64-bit integers ðŸ˜².

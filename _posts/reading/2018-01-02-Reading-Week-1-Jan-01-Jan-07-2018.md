[[6] MCE 2014: Jon Reid - Test Driven Development for iOS (and anything)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzlz3Bx-NzM){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#testing</content-meta>
- Great talk! Jon mentioned 3 types of unit testing: *return valu*, *state* and *interactions*. He also brought up dependency injection and several ways to implement it: *extract & override*, *method injection*, *property injection*, *constructor injection*, and *ambient context*.
- The Q&A is interesting as well. Some highlighting concepts were mentioned: *funtional testing*, *acceptance testing*, *data-driven testing*...

[[5] Testing on the Toilet: Testing State vs. Testing Interactions](https://testing.googleblog.com/2013/03/testing-on-toilet-testing-state-vs.html){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#testing</content-meta>
- Two key points:
> (1) Just because a test that uses interactions is passing doesn't mean the code is working properly. This is why in most cases, you want to test state, not interactions.
> 
> (2) In general, interactions should be tested when correctness doesn't just depend on what the code's output is, but also how the output is determined.

[[4] The 10 statistical techniques data scientists need to master](https://jameskle.com/writes/stat-learning){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#data-science</content-meta>
- TLDR. Details later. TIL: *Shrinkage* --> *regularization*.

[[2] The Guide to Mobile App Design: Best Practices for 2018 and Beyond](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/mobile-design/guide-mobile-app-design-best-practices-2018-beyond){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#mobile #ux #design</content-meta>
- A bit lengthy, but informative. Can treat it as a handbook of mobile UX design.
- [Not quite relevant] A minor detail about the usability of this website. When I scrolled down and saw the ads "All for free", I thought it was the end of the article and hit *Cmd + W* to leave the page. When revisiting it, I realized that I did not read the remaining content... Why? I guess it's because the advertisements do look a lot like a website *footer*.

[[1] Basics of parallel programming with Swift](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/basics-of-parallel-programming-with-swift-93fee8425287){:.post-link-reading} <content-meta>#ios #concurrency #parallelism</content-meta>
- This post provides a very good overview of how to deal with concurrency (the article did not mention much about parallelism as in the title). One take-away I am interested in is the example in the mention of *Atomic*. I thought it is the OS's duty to guarantee proper operations on 64-bit integers ðŸ˜².

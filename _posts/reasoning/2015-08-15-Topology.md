I hadn’t known Topology until a friend of mine gave me a quiz related to it. Though I still have no idea about the mathematical stuff, it has been drawing my attention due to some of its interesting facts.

### What is Topology?

I found a definition on [livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com) (more understandable than on Wiki)

> ***Topology*** is a branch of mathematics that describes mathematical ***spaces***, in particular the properties that stem from a ***space’s shape***. Many of the shapes topologists deal with are incredibly strange, so much so that practically all everyday objects such as bowls and pets and trees make up a small minority. The word “topology” derives from the Greek words for place (topos) and study (-logy).

For instance, under Topology’s perspective, a *donut* and a *coffee cup* are the same since they have a similar shape (a solid object with a hole). Similarly, a rubik’s cube is just a different version of a ball (by somehow, we can mould a cubic object into a sphere).

Another example is the DNA. After a DNA molecule unwinds, *it resembles a ladder*. So what are the implications here? Well, basically it means: ***“with the same transformation to a DNA, we may get the same result to a ladder and vice versa”***. To be specific, we can shrink a ladder with the same principle a huge DNA molecule winds itself into a smaller one.

For more typical examples, just have a look at the following videos:

### Topology - Philosophy

From my point of view, there are 2 pieces of philosophy apparently exposed:

**[1] There must be a simple instance of a complex object.** Therefore, a complicated problem could be reduced to a simpler one.

**[2] Since objects are in analogy under some aspects of consideration, the similar solutions may lead to the similar results.**

### Why does it draw my attention?

- First of all, I love visual objects.
- Secondly, I love analogy.
- And finally, I love simplicity.

### What matters?

I suppose recognizing analogy among objects is not really straightforward. Fortunately, we still have several banches of science on this field, such as Topology, Synectics and so forth.

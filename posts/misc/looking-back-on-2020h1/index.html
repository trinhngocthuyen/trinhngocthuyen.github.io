  <p>June is coming to an end soon&hellip; It&rsquo;s the end of month, the end of quarter, and also the end of the first half. It&rsquo;s time to look back on what I have done so far. About future plans, I&rsquo;d like to leave it open.</p>
<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p><span class="point">1</span> My work interest gradually shifted away from iOS. I have to admit that after a few years working as an iOS engineer, I started to like iOS a little less. As of now, I still don&rsquo;t know how to use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a>, I still truggle with making a certain UI work as expected.</p>
<p>To me, the world of iOS development is fairly small with some repetitive problems.</p>
<p>In the past six months, I have barely written any iOS code (Swift/Objective-C). Rather, I&rsquo;ve been working on some projects that involve more of scripting languages (Ruby, Python&hellip;). Although those projects are still intricately tied to iOS, it doesn&rsquo;t require much investment in keeping up-to-date with various <em>project architectures</em> and <em>trendy technologies</em>. I can find the right balance between iOS and non-iOS.</p>
<p><span class="point">2</span> It&rsquo;s easier for me to get stressed than before. I usually feel burned out. I wonder at times if the negative emotion is a side effect of COVID-19 when we&rsquo;re isolated from others, or it actually comes from my work.</p>
<p>I realize that in order to maintain healthy habits, I need to <em><strong>&ldquo;stop working&rdquo;</strong></em> at the right time. For example, I often clock out at 6:30pm and work out then. If I work a bit longer (7pm or even later), I&rsquo;ll feel tired that evening, even after the workout. Though I am fully aware of it, tackling it is a different matter. Sometimes, <em>It&rsquo;s hard to shut your brain off, keep yourself from thinking about it, put it in hibernation mode for temporary</em>&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="point">3</span> I like things to be organized. When it comes to work, although dealing with code smell is normal to any software engineer, it&rsquo;s sometimes hard for me to embrace that truth. For instance, one day, I recognized a hack in the code which explained why certain things worked in certain ways. It freaked me out rather than filled me with joy that I knew something new :(. Then, that day I need to spend time calming me down instead of dealing with the code which is the source of my frustration. One of my co-workers describes that aspect of me as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive-compulsive_disorder">OCD</a>. Hmmm&hellip; It&rsquo;s not that extreme, it&rsquo;s not OCD, but I do struggle with this matter.</p>
<p><span class="point">4</span> You probably heard of the recent news about employees getting laid off as a consequence of COVID-19&rsquo;s impact. <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/blog/grab-ceo-note">My company is no exception</a>. In fact, I&rsquo;ve never thought of that scenario and I believe some of those impacted employees also held the same belief&hellip; I am fortunate to continue contributing to the company&rsquo;s mission. But, apparently, I better be prepared for such a scenario as the health crisis and the recession are not yet over anytime soon.</p>
<h3 id="life">Life</h3>
<h4 id="health">Health</h4>
<p><span class="point">5</span> It&rsquo;s a good sign that my health has been improved lately. I work out more regularly, either running outdoor or doing indoor exercises. Having a good look is a side effect that I don&rsquo;t expect much. Rather, I just want to build up a healthy habit. At first, it was a bit challenging to follow the schedule. But after a while, I gradually formed the habit and workout has been a part of my daily routine that I would have never thought I could have.</p>
<h4 id="reading">Reading</h4>
<p><span class="point">6</span> I have a resolution this year about reading books in English. I tried to pick up some books and then gave up quickly. Even though some are of my favorite genres (if written in Vietnamese) such as detective books, mind-blowing books&hellip; I find it difficult catching up on the author&rsquo;s storylines because of improficiency in English.</p>
<h4 id="foreign-languages">Foreign Languages</h4>
<p><span class="point">7</span> I did not spend much time on improving my English in the first quarter. I have just resumed recently. I started to use Anki to learn and revise vocab. Overall, I find this app quite suitable for me&hellip; However, it takes me more effort to find new vocabs on my own and look them up again to find examples, and then input to Anki. To reduce this effort, I followed some English channels on Youtube and picked up new vocabs from those sources.</p>
<p>A funny thing is: I am a kind of person who dislikes apps that do not have a fancy look. I can spend the whole day fine-tuning colors and fonts for my IDE(s) and I won&rsquo;t admit it&rsquo;s a waste of time. And&hellip; Definitely, this Anki app fails to meet my <em>aesthetic creteria</em>. It just looks <em>corny</em> to me. But somehow, its <em>needs-improvement</em> appearance (in my view) does not bother me when I use it at all&hellip; I come to realize that its <em>intuitiveness</em> really matters here. Therefore, for those English learners who underestimate this app because of its UI, why don&rsquo;t you give it a try first?</p>
<p><span class="point">8</span> I haven&rsquo;t started learning Chinese (Mandarin, to be exact). I&rsquo;ve always made an excuse that I need to focus on English first. But I&rsquo;ve just realized that I cannot just wait until my English takes a good shape, coz that day would probably be 10 years later. And it would be a waste when I am surrounded by Mandarin speaking environment and I could not benefit from it. Thus, this is one area of growth that I am going to kick off in the next half.</p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>Looking forward&hellip; Well, let the time answer it</p>

      <description>In the previous post, we explored the overview of E2E testing in mobile development.&#xA;Today, we’re going to dive deeper into how E2E testing with Appium works on iOS.&#xA;1. Introduction to WebDriverAgent (WDA) 1.1. Running Your First Test With Appium Here’s a simple code snippet to start your tests. For simplicity, we’ll run tests on simulators.&#xA;from appium.webdriver.webdriver import WebDriver from appium.options.ios import XCUITestOptions # Create a WebDriver options = XCUITestOptions() wd = WebDriver(&amp;#39;http://127.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction End-to-end (E2E) testing is a software testing strategy that verifies the system integration from start to finish, including apps, backend services, and other related components; to ensure everything functions as expected altogether. Compared to unit tests, E2E tests are often fewer in number due to their complexity and maintenance costs. This type of testing is even more uncommon in mobile development where special setups are often required.&#xA;This blog post aims to provide a quick overview of mobile E2E testing and some opinionated architecture suggestions for incorporating E2E testing into your engineering process.</description>

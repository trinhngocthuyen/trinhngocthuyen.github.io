      <description>In the previous post, we talked about Podfile. In this post, we will look into CocoaPods plugins.
Back in early days, very few maintainers maintain quite some features. It was difficult for them to stick to the main goals of the project given a number of features being requested. Some features definitely benefit a group of users but they donâ€™t quite fit in the picture of a dependency manager.

This prevents them from troubleshooting CocoaPods issues if occurred or extending its usage.</description>

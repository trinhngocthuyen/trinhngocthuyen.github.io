      <description>P/s: Vietnamese below.
 Unemployed. After leaving Fossil, I lost my balance. There was a time I had not seen any of my friends. I missed them as much as I missed my work :). Acquired some new knowledge. While being out of work, I took part in a few courses in Coursera, MIT Opencourseware and so on. Some courses did bring me plenty of interests, headaches, and mind-blowing moments as well.</description>

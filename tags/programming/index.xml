      <description>I always thought that Tail call optimization (TCO), sometimes called tail recursion optimization, is supported in most languages by default. It turns out to be opposite.</description>

      <description>Method dispatch is a term referring to mechanisms by which the program determines which operation should be executed (by operation, I mean a set of instructions). There are times we expect a method behavior to be determined only at runtime. This motivation give rise to different mechanisms of dispatching a method, each of which has its own pros and cons.</description>

      <description>As an iOS developer, I am quite familiar with Reference Counting. It is considered a fundamental knowledge regarding memory manangement that every iOS developers must acknowledge. Today, I figured out a few more algorithms of garbage collection.
Fig 1. From left to right: Reference Counting, Mark-Sweep, Mark-Compact, Copying. Reference Counting (RC)  This is simple &amp;amp; easy to implement. However, it has some major drawbacks one of which is not being able to deal with retain cycles.</description>

      <description>1. Introduction 1.1. Pipeline time improvement As engineers, we always want to land our change on master as quickly as possible. Apart from the time it takes to resolve code review comments from peers, there&amp;rsquo;s one constraint engineers have to face before getting their changes merged. That constraint is the CI pipeline time (ie. the time it takes for a CI pipeline to run against certain changes).
For iOS development, a typical CI pre-merge pipeline usually involves building the project, then running unit tests and UI tests.</description>

      <title>MVVM best practice: Inputs - Outputs</title>

      <description>When it comes to iOS architecture, MVVM is one of the most favorable candidates. Not only does it provide higher testability than MVC but also this architecture is lightweight as compared to its counterparts such as VIPER. Despite that, proper approaches should be adopted to take advantage of MVVM. Otherwise, we could end up with an alike version of MVC with an additional component (ViewModel).</description>

      <description>There are times we wish to fake a network event, for example, a network error. However, integrating a 3rd party stub library just for this purpose is not really worthy. This post aims at demonstrating how to stub network.</description>

      <title>Method Swizzling: What, Why and How</title>
      <link>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-swizzling-what-why-and-how/</link>

      <guid>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-swizzling-what-why-and-how/</guid>
      <description>Method swizzling is a very powerful technique that takes advantage of dynamism. The core idea of this technique is to replace the real implementation of a method at runtime. With this power, we could be able to do a lot of cool stuffs. Actually, this special feature is offered by the Objective-C runtime, via message dispatch.</description>

      <title>Method dispatch in Swift</title>
      <link>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-dispatch-in-swift/</link>

      <guid>https://trinhngocthuyen.github.io/posts/tech/method-dispatch-in-swift/</guid>
      <description>Method dispatch is a term referring to mechanisms by which the program determines which operation should be executed (by operation, I mean a set of instructions). There are times we expect a method behavior to be determined only at runtime. This motivation give rise to different mechanisms of dispatching a method, each of which has its own pros and cons.</description>
